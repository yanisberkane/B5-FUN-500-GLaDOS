# GLaDOS - A Haskell-Based Programming Language

## Overview

GLaDOS (Generic Language and Data Operand Syntax) is a custom programming language implemented in Haskell. The project's aim is to create a minimalist yet functional programming environment, inspired by languages like LISP and Scheme, and is designed with a focus on functional programming principles.

## Features

- **Custom Language Design**: Implementing a language from scratch, including parsing, syntax, and semantics.
- **Build System**: Compilation via Makefile with `re`, `clean`, and `fclean` rules. Stack is recommended for building.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests, with continuous integration and delivery setups.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful output.
- **Functional Paradigms**: Emphasis on functional programming concepts like lambda expressions, closures, and immutable data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Haskell
- Stack (recommended build tool)

### Installationa

For Linux distributions, you need to run `./setup-haskell-stack.sh` in order to install Haskell and Stack.

Then, run `make build` to build GLaDOS binary.

### Running the Language

To run a program written in GLaDOS, use the following command:

./glados < your_program.glados

shell

### Examples

(define foo 21)
(* foo 2)

shell

Output: `42`
